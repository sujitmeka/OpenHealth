## Levine PhenoAge Formula

**Source:** Levine et al. (2018) "An epigenetic biomarker of aging for lifespan and healthspan"
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101414

### Required Biomarkers (9 inputs)

| Biomarker | Unit | Variable Name |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Albumin | g/dL | albumin |
| Creatinine | mg/dL | creatinine |
| Glucose (fasting) | mg/dL | glucose |
| C-Reactive Protein (CRP) | mg/L | crp |
| Lymphocyte Percent | % | lymphocyte_pct |
| Mean Cell Volume (MCV) | fL | mcv |
| Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) | % | rdw |
| Alkaline Phosphatase | U/L | alp |
| White Blood Cell Count | 10³/µL | wbc |
| Chronological Age | years | age |

### Calculation Steps

**Step 1: Calculate xb (linear combination)**
```
xb = -19.9067
     - 0.0336 × albumin
     + 0.0095 × creatinine
     + 0.1953 × glucose
     + 0.0954 × ln(crp)
     - 0.0120 × lymphocyte_pct
     + 0.0268 × mcv
     + 0.3306 × rdw
     + 0.00188 × alp
     + 0.0554 × wbc
     + 0.0804 × age
```

Note: `ln(crp)` is the natural logarithm of CRP.

**Step 2: Calculate mortality risk (m)**
```
m = 1 - exp(-exp(xb) × (exp(120 × 0.0077) - 1) / 0.0077)
```

**Step 3: Calculate PhenoAge**
```
PhenoAge = 141.50225 + ln(-0.00553 × ln(1 - m)) / 0.090165
```

### Implementation Notes

- If CRP ≤ 0, use CRP = 0.01 (avoid log of zero)
- All biomarkers must be present; return null if any missing
- Round PhenoAge to 1 decimal place for display
- Delta = PhenoAge - Chronological Age (negative = biologically younger)

### Example Calculation

```
Inputs:
  albumin = 4.5 g/dL
  creatinine = 0.9 mg/dL
  glucose = 85 mg/dL
  crp = 0.5 mg/L
  lymphocyte_pct = 30%
  mcv = 88 fL
  rdw = 12.5%
  alp = 50 U/L
  wbc = 5.5 10³/µL
  age = 35 years

Expected output:
  PhenoAge ≈ 31.2 years
  Delta = -3.8 years (biologically younger)
```

## Body Composition (DEXA)

### Reference Ranges

| Metric | Optimal (M) | Optimal (F) | Unit |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Body Fat % | 10-18 | 18-25 | % |
| Visceral Fat | <1.0 | <1.0 | lbs |
| Bone Mineral Density | T-score > -1 | T-score > -1 | — |
| Appendicular Lean Mass Index | >7.26 | >5.45 | kg/m² |

### Interpretation

- **Body Fat %:** Lower is generally better for metabolic health, but too low (<6% M, <14% F) is unhealthy
- **Visceral Fat:** Fat around organs; strongly linked to metabolic disease
- **Bone Density:** T-score compares to young adult; >-1 is normal, -1 to -2.5 is osteopenia, <-2.5 is osteoporosis
- **ALMI:** Appendicular Lean Mass Index = (arm + leg lean mass in kg) / height²

## Activity Metrics

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

| Age | Good | Excellent | Unit |

| 20-29 | 55-80 | >80 | ms (RMSSD) |
| 30-39 | 50-75 | >75 | ms |

| 50-59 | 35-55 | >55 | ms |
| 60+ | 25-45 | >45 | ms |

Higher HRV = better recovery capacity and parasympathetic tone.

### Resting Heart Rate

| Average | 60-70 | bpm |
| Below Average | 70-80 | bpm |
| Poor | >80 | bpm |

### Sleep

| Duration | 7-9 | 6-10 | hours |
| REM % | 20-25 | 15-30 | % |
| Deep Sleep % | 15-20 | 10-25 | % |
| Sleep Efficiency | >90 | >85 | % |
